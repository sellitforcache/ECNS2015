The coupling between the two simulation suites typically consists of providing analytical fits of \{MCNPX\} neutron spectra to McStas. This method is generally successful but has limitations, as it e.g. does not allow for re-entry of neutrons into the \{MCNPX\} regime. Previous work to resolve such shortcomings includes the introduction of McStas inspired supermirrors in MCNPX. In the present paper different approaches to interface \{MCNPX\} and McStas are presented and applied to a simple test case. The direct coupling between \{MCNPX\} and McStas allows for more accurate simulations of e.g. complex moderator geometries, backgrounds, interference between beam-lines as well as shielding requirements along the neutron guides.

		abstract = "Abstract Large spallation neutron facilities share with compact sources the constraint that the moderation of neutrons relies on a random scattering process. Recently, proposals have been made how to furnish cold moderators with some preferential direction for the scattering and the emission of cold neutrons. Propositions presented so far aim primarily at enhancing the emission of moderated neutrons out of the scattering volume. The use of silicon single crystals and nano-structured material has been proposed to boost or suppress scattering along selected directions, respectively. The recent implementation of a beryllium reflector-filter for a hydrogen moderator system at the Manuel Lujan neutron scattering center augmented moderated neutron flux by reflecting thermal neutrons back into a cold moderator. This installation has met with striking success and proved the technical feasibility of selectable preferential provision of cold and thermal neutrons. In this short contribution a tiny scoping study is presented together with a conceptual sketch of a novel moderator set-up. The approach strives to combine the existing results with some additional measures for increasing the primary neutron flux inside a cold moderator. Even base-lining some generic boundary conditions and not taking peculiarities of materials into account, moderator performance can be improved by mere geometrical internal modifications. Conceiving a “pre-moderator” primarily as “primary reflector” appears to offer additional possibilities for optimization. The expectation is that, depending on design and materials’ choices, mixed or cold spectra can be obtained, with the flux of demanded neutrons increased along selected directions of preferential emission. Anticipating more extensive confirmative numerical simulations, the obvious next step could be a first test of the proposed concept at a compact neutron source. "

		abstract = "Abstract At a spallation neutron source, significant increase in the performance of neutron scattering instruments can be achieved if the target-moderator-reflector (TMR) and the following neutron guides are specifically tailored to the needs of different instrument classes. In order to define optimal quantities (e.g. positions of peak neutron flux, used wavelength band) for the Figure of Merit (FoM), a survey has been conducted at \{PSI\} covering the experience of the local instrument scientists. Based on this survey we introduce several FoMs which show the potential of tailoring the neutron spectrum to specific instrument needs. The developed methodology is adopted to optimize the top moderator in the conceptual design of the \{TMR\} of the European Spallation Source (ESS) Project. A parametrized geometry model of the \{ESS\} \{TMR\} is built in \{MCNPX\} and used within an optimization framework to study and optimize the moderator performance in the thermal and cold regions of the neutron spectrum. The results obtained with the optimized setup are compared to the \{ESS\} 2003 Project. Furthermore, experience is gathered while performing these simulations, e.g. the examination of the pulse shapes obtained with time-dependent calculations shows that for long-pulse target stations the peak brightness can with sufficient precision be obtained from time-independent calculations by scaling with the proton pulse duty factor.
