		abstract = "Simulations of target-moderator-reflector system at spallation sources are conventionally carried out using Monte Carlo codes such as \{MCNPX\} (Waters et al., 2007 [1]) or \{FLUKA\} (Battistoni et al., 2007; Ferrari et al., 2005 [2,3]) whereas simulations of neutron transport from the moderator and the instrument response are performed by neutron ray tracing codes such as McStas (Lefmann and Nielsen, 1999; Willendrup et al., 2004, 2011a,b [4–7]). The coupling between the two simulation suites typically consists of providing analytical fits of \{MCNPX\} neutron spectra to McStas. This method is generally successful but has limitations, as it e.g. does not allow for re-entry of neutrons into the \{MCNPX\} regime. Previous work to resolve such shortcomings includes the introduction of McStas inspired supermirrors in MCNPX. In the present paper different approaches to interface \{MCNPX\} and McStas are presented and applied to a simple test case. The direct coupling between \{MCNPX\} and McStas allows for more accurate simulations of e.g. complex moderator geometries, backgrounds, interference between beam-lines as well as shielding requirements along the neutron guides.
